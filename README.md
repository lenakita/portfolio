## Portfolio Website
This is the open source code for my portfolio website hosted at [url-here](), created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## TODO
- Deploy using GitHub actions rather than Vercel.
- Amend comments in index.js.

## Getting Started

Install all the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard).

The [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) has more details.

## Learn More
